## 📱 ZenTrack: Personal Mindfulness & Mood Tracker for Students Abroad

**ZenTrack** is a cross-platform mobile app built to support the emotional well-being of international students. With features like emoji-based mood tracking, customizable habit check-ins, journaling, and AI-driven mental wellness suggestions, ZenTrack offers a simple yet powerful daily self-care experience.

The app is developed using **React Native (with Expo)** for a smooth mobile UI and **Node.js + Express** for backend logic. Optionally, it connects to **MongoDB** for persistent storage of user data. Axios is used for frontend-backend communication, and Lottie animations enhance mindfulness through guided breathing visuals.

Users can select a mood emoji, mark completed habits like sleep or exercise, and write a short journal note. On submission, the app sends this data to the backend, which analyzes it and returns a motivational suggestion based on emotional cues found in the mood and notes. The app then displays this suggestion in real-time.

### 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React Native, Expo, LottieView, Axios
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
* **Database**: MongoDB (optional, via Mongoose)
* **AI Layer (Planned)**: TensorFlow\.js for mood forecasting

### 🚀 Key Features

* Mood tracking with emoji UI
* Daily habit checklists
* Journaling support
* Personalized self-care suggestions
* Breathing animations
* Future support for trends, exports, and buddy matching

> “ZenTrack isn’t just a tracker — it’s a personal wellness companion designed to support your emotional growth, one check-in at a time.”
